This workshop is intended to deploy the following items during the 5 labs

- Transit Gateway in a single region and account
- Adding an additional VPC, from a different account
- Using route tables to isolate traffic
- Extending the transit gateway to a different region
- Mirroring traffic to monitor what is going through the NAT instance

As such, the final architecture will look like this
