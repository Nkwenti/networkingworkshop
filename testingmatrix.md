### Testing matrix

For testing all the various ping and http requests and making sure you have completed all the combinations, you can use the excel spreadsheet  available [here](https://networking-workshop.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/testing+matrix.xlsx)

The first tab is blank for you to fill in results, but the subsequent tabs contain the expected results, so that you can make sure the labs are functioning as expected.
